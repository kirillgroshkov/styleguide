# Angular

Based on [Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) by John Papa.

## Single Responsibility

### Rule of 1
###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

  - Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.

  *Why?*: One component per file promotes easier unit testing and mocking.

  *Why?*: One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.

  *Why?*: One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

  The following example defines the `app` module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute'])
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController)
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function SomeController() { }

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

  The same components are now separated into their own files.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // app.module.js
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute']);
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.controller.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.factory.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function someFactory() { }
  ```
  
### Small Functions
###### [Style [Y002](#style-y002)]

  - Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.

  *Why?*: Small functions promote reuse.

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to read.

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to maintain.

  *Why?*: Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.


## Modules

### Definitions (aka Setters)
###### [Style [Y021](#style-y021)]

  - Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.

  *Why?*: With 1 component per file, there is rarely a need to introduce a variable for the module.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app', [
      'ngAnimate',
      'ngRoute',
      'app.shared',
      'app.dashboard'
  ]);
  ```

  Instead use the simple setter syntax.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app', [
          'ngAnimate',
          'ngRoute',
          'app.shared',
          'app.dashboard'
      ]);
  ```
  
### Getters
###### [Style [Y022](#style-y022)]

  - When using a module, avoid using a variable and instead use chaining with the getter syntax.

  *Why?*: This produces more readable code and avoids variable collisions or leaks.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app');
  app.controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```
  
### Setting vs Getting
###### [Style [Y023](#style-y023)]

  - Only set once and get for all other instances.

  *Why?*: A module should only be created once, then retrieved from that point and after.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // to set a module
  angular.module('app', []);

  // to get a module
  angular.module('app');
  ```
  
## Controllers

### Bindable Members Up Top
###### [Style [Y033](#style-y033)]

  - Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.

    *Why?*: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.

    *Why?*: Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability. Defining the functions below the bindable members (the functions will be hoisted) moves the implementation details down, keeps the bindable members up top, and makes it easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function SessionsController() {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.refresh = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.search = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function SessionsController() {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = refresh;
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';

      ////////////

      function gotoSession() {
        /* */
      }

      function refresh() {
        /* */
      }

      function search() {
        /* */
      }
  }
  ```

    ![Controller Using "Above the Fold"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/above-the-fold-1.png)

  Note: If the function is a 1 liner consider keeping it right up top, as long as readability is not affected.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function SessionsController(data) {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = function() {
          /**
           * lines
           * of
           * code
           * affects
           * readability
           */
      };
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function SessionsController(sessionDataService) {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = sessionDataService.refresh; // 1 liner is OK
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```

### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
###### [Style [Y034](#style-y034)]

  - Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your bindable members up top. When you need to bind a function in a controller, point it to a function declaration that appears later in the file. This is tied directly to the section Bindable Members Up Top. For more details see [this post](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-function-declarations-function-expressions-and-readable-code/).

    *Why?*: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View. (Same as above.)

    *Why?*: Placing the implementation details of a function later in the file moves that complexity out of view so you can see the important stuff up top.

    *Why?*: Function declaration are hoisted so there are no concerns over using a function before it is defined (as there would be with function expressions).

    *Why?*: You never have to worry with function declarations that moving `var a` before `var b` will break your code because `a` depends on `b`.

    *Why?*: Order is critical with function expressions

  ```javascript
  /**
   * avoid
   * Using function expressions.
   */
  function AvengersController(avengersService, logger) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      var activate = function() {
          return getAvengers().then(function() {
              logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
          });
      }

      var getAvengers = function() {
          return avengersService.getAvengers().then(function(data) {
              vm.avengers = data;
              return vm.avengers;
          });
      }

      vm.getAvengers = getAvengers;

      activate();
  }
  ```

  Notice that the important stuff is scattered in the preceding example. In the example below, notice that the important stuff is up top. For example, the members bound to the controller such as `vm.avengers` and `vm.title`. The implementation details are down below. This is just easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /*
   * recommend
   * Using function declarations
   * and bindable members up top.
   */
  function AvengersController(avengersService, logger) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.getAvengers = getAvengers;
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      activate();

      function activate() {
          return getAvengers().then(function() {
              logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
          });
      }

      function getAvengers() {
          return avengersService.getAvengers().then(function(data) {
              vm.avengers = data;
              return vm.avengers;
          });
      }
  }
  ```

### Defer Controller Logic to Services
###### [Style [Y035](#style-y035)]

  - Defer logic in a controller by delegating to services and factories.

    *Why?*: Logic may be reused by multiple controllers when placed within a service and exposed via a function.

    *Why?*: Logic in a service can more easily be isolated in a unit test, while the calling logic in the controller can be easily mocked.

    *Why?*: Removes dependencies and hides implementation details from the controller.

    *Why?*: Keeps the controller slim, trim, and focused.

  ```javascript

  /* avoid */
  function OrderController($http, $q, config, userInfo) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.checkCredit = checkCredit;
      vm.isCreditOk;
      vm.total = 0;

      function checkCredit() {
          var settings = {};
          // Get the credit service base URL from config
          // Set credit service required headers
          // Prepare URL query string or data object with request data
          // Add user-identifying info so service gets the right credit limit for this user.
          // Use JSONP for this browser if it doesn't support CORS
          return $http.get(settings)
              .then(function(data) {
               // Unpack JSON data in the response object
                 // to find maxRemainingAmount
                 vm.isCreditOk = vm.total <= maxRemainingAmount
              })
              .catch(function(error) {
                 // Interpret error
                 // Cope w/ timeout? retry? try alternate service?
                 // Re-reject with appropriate error for a user to see
              });
      };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function OrderController(creditService) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.checkCredit = checkCredit;
      vm.isCreditOk;
      vm.total = 0;

      function checkCredit() {
         return creditService.isOrderTotalOk(vm.total)
            .then(function(isOk) { vm.isCreditOk = isOk; })
            .catch(showError);
      };
  }
  ```

### Keep Controllers Focused
###### [Style [Y037](#style-y037)]

  - Define a controller for a view, and try not to reuse the controller for other views. Instead, move reusable logic to factories and keep the controller simple and focused on its view.

    *Why?*: Reusing controllers with several views is brittle and good end-to-end (e2e) test coverage is required to ensure stability across large applications.


## Services

### Accessible Members Up Top
###### [Style [Y052](#style-y052)]

  - Expose the callable members of the service (its interface) at the top, using a technique derived from the [Revealing Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript).

    *Why?*: Placing the callable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the service can be called and must be unit tested (and/or mocked).

    *Why?*: This is especially helpful when the file gets longer as it helps avoid the need to scroll to see what is exposed.

    *Why?*: Setting functions as you go can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability and cause more scrolling. Defining the callable interface via the returned service moves the implementation details down, keeps the callable interface up top, and makes it easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function dataService() {
    var someValue = '';
    function save() {
      /* */
    };
    function validate() {
      /* */
    };

    return {
        save: save,
        someValue: someValue,
        validate: validate
    };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function dataService() {
      var someValue = '';
      var service = {
          save: save,
          someValue: someValue,
          validate: validate
      };
      return service;

      ////////////

      function save() {
          /* */
      };

      function validate() {
          /* */
      };
  }
  ```

  This way bindings are mirrored across the host object, primitive values cannot update alone using the revealing module pattern.
  
 ![Factories Using "Above the Fold"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/above-the-fold-2.png)
 

### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
###### [Style [Y053](#style-y053)]

  - Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your accessible members of the factory up top. Point those to function declarations that appears later in the file. For more details see [this post](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-function-declarations-function-expressions-and-readable-code).

    *Why?*: Placing accessible members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which functions of the factory you can access externally.

    *Why?*: Placing the implementation details of a function later in the file moves that complexity out of view so you can see the important stuff up top.

    *Why?*: Function declaration are hoisted so there are no concerns over using a function before it is defined (as there would be with function expressions).

    *Why?*: You never have to worry with function declarations that moving `var a` before `var b` will break your code because `a` depends on `b`.

    *Why?*: Order is critical with function expressions

  ```javascript
  /**
   * avoid
   * Using function expressions
   */
   function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
      var isPrimed = false;
      var primePromise;

      var getAvengers = function() {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var getAvengerCount = function() {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var getAvengersCast = function() {
         // implementation details go here
      };

      var prime = function() {
         // implementation details go here
      };

      var ready = function(nextPromises) {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var service = {
          getAvengersCast: getAvengersCast,
          getAvengerCount: getAvengerCount,
          getAvengers: getAvengers,
          ready: ready
      };

      return service;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /**
   * recommended
   * Using function declarations
   * and accessible members up top.
   */
  function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
      var isPrimed = false;
      var primePromise;

      var service = {
          getAvengersCast: getAvengersCast,
          getAvengerCount: getAvengerCount,
          getAvengers: getAvengers,
          ready: ready
      };

      return service;

      ////////////

      function getAvengers() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function getAvengerCount() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function getAvengersCast() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function prime() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function ready(nextPromises) {
          // implementation details go here
      }
  }
  ```

## Directives
### Limit 1 Per File
###### [Style [Y070](#style-y070)]

  - Create one directive per file. Name the file for the directive.

    *Why?*: It is easy to mash all the directives in one file, but difficult to then break those out so some are shared across apps, some across modules, some just for one module.

    *Why?*: One directive per file is easy to maintain.

    > Note: "**Best Practice**: Directives should clean up after themselves. You can use `element.on('$destroy', ...)` or `scope.$on('$destroy', ...)` to run a clean-up function when the directive is removed" ... from the Angular documentation.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  /* directives.js */

  angular
      .module('app.widgets')

      /* order directive that is specific to the order module */
      .directive('orderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange)

      /* sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app */
      .directive('salesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo)

      /* spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps */
      .directive('sharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* calendar-range.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc order directive that is specific to the order module at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-order-calendar-range></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('sales.order')
      .directive('acmeOrderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* customer-info.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-sales-customer-info></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('sales.widgets')
      .directive('acmeSalesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo);

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* spinner.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-shared-spinner></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('shared.widgets')
      .directive('acmeSharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

    Note: There are many naming options for directives, especially since they can be used in narrow or wide scopes. Choose one that makes the directive and its file name distinct and clear. Some examples are below, but see the [Naming](#naming) section for more recommendations.
    
    
### Manipulate DOM in a Directive
###### [Style [Y072](#style-y072)]

  - When manipulating the DOM directly, use a directive. If alternative ways can be used such as using CSS to set styles or the [animation services](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate), Angular templating, [`ngShow`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) or [`ngHide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide), then use those instead. For example, if the directive simply hides and shows, use ngHide/ngShow.

    *Why?*: DOM manipulation can be difficult to test, debug, and there are often better ways (e.g. CSS, animations, templates)

### Provide a Unique Directive Prefix
###### [Style [Y073](#style-y073)]

  - Provide a short, unique and descriptive directive prefix such as `acmeSalesCustomerInfo` which would be declared in HTML as `acme-sales-customer-info`.

    *Why?*: The unique short prefix identifies the directive's context and origin. For example a prefix of `cc-` may indicate that the directive is part of a CodeCamper app while `acme-` may indicate a directive for the Acme company.

    Note: Avoid `ng-` as these are reserved for Angular directives. Research widely used directives to avoid naming conflicts, such as `ion-` for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).


### Restrict to Elements and Attributes
###### [Style [Y074](#style-y074)]

  - When creating a directive that makes sense as a stand-alone element, allow restrict `E` (custom element) and optionally restrict `A` (custom attribute). Generally, if it could be its own control, `E` is appropriate. General guideline is allow `EA` but lean towards implementing as an element when it's stand-alone and as an attribute when it enhances its existing DOM element.

    *Why?*: It makes sense.

    *Why?*: While we can allow the directive to be used as a class, if the directive is truly acting as an element it makes more sense as an element or at least as an attribute.

    Note: EA is the default for Angular 1.3 +

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <div class="my-calendar-range"></div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app.widgets')
      .directive('myCalendarRange', myCalendarRange);

  function myCalendarRange() {
      var directive = {
          link: link,
          templateUrl: '/template/is/located/here.html',
          restrict: 'C'
      };
      return directive;

      function link(scope, element, attrs) {
        /* */
      }
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <my-calendar-range></my-calendar-range>
  <div my-calendar-range></div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app.widgets')
      .directive('myCalendarRange', myCalendarRange);

  function myCalendarRange() {
      var directive = {
          link: link,
          templateUrl: '/template/is/located/here.html',
          restrict: 'EA'
      };
      return directive;

      function link(scope, element, attrs) {
        /* */
      }
  }
  ```

## Resolving Promises
### Controller Activation Promises
###### [Style [Y080](#style-y080)]

  - Resolve start-up logic for a controller in an `activate` function.

    *Why?*: Placing start-up logic in a consistent place in the controller makes it easier to locate, more consistent to test, and helps avoid spreading out the activation logic across the controller.

    *Why?*: The controller `activate` makes it convenient to re-use the logic for a refresh for the controller/View, keeps the logic together, gets the user to the View faster, makes animations easy on the `ng-view` or `ui-view`, and feels snappier to the user.

    Note: If you need to conditionally cancel the route before you start using the controller, use a [route resolve](#style-y081) instead.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function AvengersController(dataservice) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      dataservice.getAvengers().then(function(data) {
          vm.avengers = data;
          return vm.avengers;
      });
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function AvengersController(dataservice) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      activate();

      ////////////

      function activate() {
          return dataservice.getAvengers().then(function(data) {
              vm.avengers = data;
              return vm.avengers;
          });
      }
  }
  ```

### Handling Exceptions with Promises
###### [Style [Y082](#style-y082)]

  - The `catch` block of a promise must return a rejected promise to maintain the exception in the promise chain.

  - Always handle exceptions in services/factories.

    *Why?*: If the `catch` block does not return a rejected promise, the caller of the promise will not know an exception occurred. The caller's `then` will execute. Thus, the user may never know what happened.

    *Why?*: To avoid swallowing errors and misinforming the user.

    Note: Consider putting any exception handling in a function in a shared module and service.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */

  function getCustomer(id) {
      return $http.get('/api/customer/' + id)
          .then(getCustomerComplete)
          .catch(getCustomerFailed);

      function getCustomerComplete(data, status, headers, config) {
          return data.data;
      }

      function getCustomerFailed(e) {
          var newMessage = 'XHR Failed for getCustomer'
          if (e.data && e.data.description) {
            newMessage = newMessage + '\n' + e.data.description;
          }
          e.data.description = newMessage;
          logger.error(newMessage);
          // ***
          // Notice there is no return of the rejected promise
          // ***
      }
  }

  /* recommended */
  function getCustomer(id) {
      return $http.get('/api/customer/' + id)
          .then(getCustomerComplete)
          .catch(getCustomerFailed);

      function getCustomerComplete(data, status, headers, config) {
          return data.data;
      }

      function getCustomerFailed(e) {
          var newMessage = 'XHR Failed for getCustomer'
          if (e.data && e.data.description) {
            newMessage = newMessage + '\n' + e.data.description;
          }
          e.data.description = newMessage;
          logger.error(newMessage);
          return $q.reject(e);
      }
  }
  ```

## Application Structure LIFT Principle
### LIFT
###### [Style [Y140](#style-y140)]

  - Structure your app such that you can `L`ocate your code quickly, `I`dentify the code at a glance, keep the `F`lattest structure you can, and `T`ry to stay DRY. The structure should follow these 4 basic guidelines.

    *Why LIFT?*: Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check your app structure is to ask yourself: How quickly can you open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

    When I find my structure is not feeling comfortable, I go back and revisit these LIFT guidelines

    1. `L`ocating our code is easy
    2. `I`dentify code at a glance
    3. `F`lat structure as long as we can
    4. `T`ry to stay DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY

### Locate
###### [Style [Y141](#style-y141)]

  - Make locating your code intuitive, simple and fast.

    *Why?*: I find this to be super important for a project. If the team cannot find the files they need to work on quickly, they will not be able to work as efficiently as possible, and the structure needs to change. You may not know the file name or where its related files are, so putting them in the most intuitive locations and near each other saves a ton of time. A descriptive folder structure can help with this.

    ```
    /bower_components
    /client
      /app
        /avengers
        /blocks
          /exception
          /logger
        /core
        /dashboard
        /data
        /layout
        /widgets
      /content
      index.html
    .bower.json
    ```

### Identify
###### [Style [Y142](#style-y142)]

  - When you look at a file you should instantly know what it contains and represents.

    *Why?*: You spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means you want longer file names, then so be it. Be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly 1 component. Avoid files with multiple controllers, multiple services, or a mixture. There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when I have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, they are still easily identifiable.

### Flat
###### [Style [Y143](#style-y143)]

  - Keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. When you get to 7+ files, begin considering separation.

    *Why?*: Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. Think about menus on web sites … anything deeper than 2 should take serious consideration. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. Base it on your comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.

### T-DRY (Try to Stick to DRY)
###### [Style [Y144](#style-y144)]

  - Be DRY, but don't go nuts and sacrifice readability.

    *Why?*: Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why I call it T-DRY. I don’t want to type session-view.html for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then I name it.

## Application Structure

### Overall Guidelines
###### [Style [Y150](#style-y150)]

  - Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. In other words, start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. All of the app's code goes in a root folder named `app`. All content is 1 feature per file. Each controller, service, module, view is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the `app` folder. I didn't write them and I don't want them cluttering my app (`bower_components`, `scripts`, `lib`).

    Note: Find more details and reasoning behind the structure at [this original post on application structure](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/).

### Layout
###### [Style [Y151](#style-y151)]

  - Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named `layout`. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.

    *Why?*: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.

## Modularity

### Many Small, Self Contained Modules
###### [Style [Y160](#style-y160)]

  - Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility.

    *Why?*: Modular applications make it easy to plug and go as they allow the development teams to build vertical slices of the applications and roll out incrementally. This means we can plug in new features as we develop them.

### Create an App Module
###### [Style [Y161](#style-y161)]

  - Create an application root module whose role is to pull together all of the modules and features of your application. Name this for your application.

    *Why?*: Angular encourages modularity and separation patterns. Creating an application root module whose role is to tie your other modules together provides a very straightforward way to add or remove modules from your application.

### Keep the App Module Thin
###### [Style [Y162](#style-y162)]

  - Only put logic for pulling together the app in the application module. Leave features in their own modules.

    *Why?*: Adding additional roles to the application root to get remote data, display views, or other logic not related to pulling the app together muddies the app module and make both sets of features harder to reuse or turn off.

    *Why?*: The app module becomes a manifest that describes which modules help define the application.

### Feature Areas are Modules
###### [Style [Y163](#style-y163)]

  - Create modules that represent feature areas, such as layout, reusable and shared services, dashboards, and app specific features (e.g. customers, admin, sales).

    *Why?*: Self contained modules can be added to the application with little or no friction.

    *Why?*: Sprints or iterations can focus on feature areas and turn them on at the end of the sprint or iteration.

    *Why?*: Separating feature areas into modules makes it easier to test the modules in isolation and reuse code.

### Reusable Blocks are Modules
###### [Style [Y164](#style-y164)]

  - Create modules that represent reusable application blocks for common services such as exception handling, logging, diagnostics, security, and local data stashing.

    *Why?*: These types of features are needed in many applications, so by keeping them separated in their own modules they can be application generic and be reused across applications.

## Angular $ Wrapper Services

### $document and $window
###### [Style [Y180](#style-y180)]

  - Use [`$document`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$document) and [`$window`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$window) instead of `document` and `window`.

    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable than using document and window in tests. This helps you avoid having to mock document and window yourself.

### $timeout and $interval
###### [Style [Y181](#style-y181)]

  - Use [`$timeout`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout) and [`$interval`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$interval) instead of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` .

    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable and handle Angular's digest cycle thus keeping data binding in sync.


## Constants

### Vendor Globals
###### [Style [Y240](#style-y240)]

  - Create an Angular Constant for vendor libraries' global variables.

    *Why?*: Provides a way to inject vendor libraries that otherwise are globals. This improves code testability by allowing you to more easily know what the dependencies of your components are (avoids leaky abstractions). It also allows you to mock these dependencies, where it makes sense.

    ```javascript
    // constants.js

    /* global toastr:false, moment:false */
    (function() {
        'use strict';

        angular
            .module('app.core')
            .constant('toastr', toastr)
            .constant('moment', moment);
    })();
    ```
