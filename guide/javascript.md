Apply [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with the following exceptions:

- 7.11: we also require space after function name
- 9.x: we don't use classes much yet
- 10: we don't use modules yet
- 11: disagree for now, iterators look simpler
- 15.1: yes when writing new code. "No" for refactoring your old code (it may unexpectedly break!)
- 17.1
- 18.12: limit is 160 chars
- 20.1: we apply [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/) "no semicolons" rule
- 21.x
- 22.4, 22.5: doesn't apply since we don't use classes
- 23: favour accessors (jQuery-style)
- 24
- 27
